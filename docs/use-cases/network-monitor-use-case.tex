\section*{Objective}
Monitor 10 systems on a network and view their status.

\section*{LLNMS Scope}
This involves managing network assets.  The primary objective is to 
create the assets, create the desired scanning tools, then scan assets
periodically.

\section*{Tasks Required}

\subsection*{Create Assets}
To create assets, use \texttt{llnms-create-asset}.  This will create
the asset for LLNMS to use.

\subsection*{Create Scanners}
Scanners should be created manually.

\subsection*{Register Scanners}
To register a scanner to the llnms-registered-scanners.xml list, use
\texttt{llnms-register-scanner}.

\subsection*{Register Assets}
Asset registration will add each available scanner to the asset and allow the user to 
configure them as necessary. To register an asset, use \texttt{llnms-register-asset}.

\subsection*{Scan Assets}
Asset scanning will run each scanner for the asset and report the results.  To run a scan
on all assets, use \texttt{llnms-scan-assets}.  To run a scan on an individual asset, run
\texttt{llnms-scan-asset}.
