\section*{Design}

\subsection*{Overview}
The chief objective with LLNMS is \emph{modularity} and
\emph{independence}.  Network Management Systems (NMS) tend
to consist of a single application which does all of the work.  
LLNMS seeks to be a collection of tools which chained together 
designate a complete NMS solution. 


\subsubsection*{Networks}

LLNMS allows you to scan a network to view all available or detected assets.  This 
can be used to monitor the health of a network infrastructure or to detect intruders into
a system.  To implement this capability, LLNMS scans a network using a specified set of 
rules.  

\section*{Hierarchy}

LLNMS operates as an independent set of utilities which depend on 
a deterministic file and directory structure. 

\subsubsection*{LLNMS\_HOME}
This is the base directory for which all LLNMS activity takes place.  This
contains all configuration files, utilities, and output.  On linux systems, 
the designated home is at \texttt{/var/tmp/llnms}.
